# The FleviOS Makefile
Simply download the Makefile in this repo (basically a fancy text file for making things),
then run these 2 commands:

> [!WARNING]
> This will make your current directory the FleviOS Build Enviroment.

```
make setup   # Installs dependencies and sets up the folder
make run     # Builds and launches FleviOS in QEMU
```

> [!NOTE]
> Not running? Try installing `make` and `qemu-system-i386` (or just `qemu`)
